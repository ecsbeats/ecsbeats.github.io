My name is `Adam Blumenfeld`, `CEO` at [`CSX Labs`](http://csxlabs.org).

## Mission
My mission in the world is to advance technology for humanity. I want to make as large of an impact as possible during my lifetime, and in my current situation I believe that the best way to achive that is through open-source.

## What I do?
I currently contribute to a vareity of open-source projects and promote open-source at my school. I am currently working on a project called Lockermatch which is the locker assignment system at my school. I am also exploring and testing software from many industries, from quantum to blockchain.

## My Interests
### Distributed Systems
I find distributed systems and cloud infrastructure interesting. I've pursued my interest by watching many [InfoQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQX1tChV7Z7l1LFF4L9j_g) videos aswell as taking a few courses and labs on the subject (certificates in my LinkedIn).

### Company Culture & Practice
I also find company culture fascinating and have studied the dynamics of large companies and startups for the past two years. I am also interested the evolution of engineering culture over time in startups. The most helpful resources for me on this topic were:
* [Y Combinator Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/) - An 8 week online course on starting a startup by a well-known startup accelerator. It teaches the fundamentals of a startup as well as the progression of a successful startup. 
* [How Google Works](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/Yk9zAwAAQBAJ?hl=en) - A book on the origins and evolution of Google's culture. This book introduces a special type of engineer that they deem a "smart creative" and details how to find and retain them.
* [Software Engineering At Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) - A technical book on engineering culture and practices at Google. This book details everything from Version Control to Psycological Safety to Hyrum's Law.
