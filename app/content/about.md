My name is `Adam Blumenfeld`, `CEO` at `CSX Labs`. As an executive and software engineer, my chief mission in the world is to advance technology for the betterment of humanity. With a strong belief in the transformative power of open-source technology, I am dedicated to making the largest impact possible during my lifetime.

Currently, I actively contribute to a diverse range of open-source projects and promote their adoption in educational institutions and emerging industries. One of my ongoing projects is Lockermatch, a locker assignment system being implemented at my school. Additionally, I am constantly exploring and testing software from a wide array of industries, including quantum computing and blockchain technology.

My key interests include:

#### Distributed Systems

I am fascinated by distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, having pursued this interest through various online courses and certifications. I often watch and learn from informative [InfoQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQX1tChV7Z7l1LFF4L9j_g) videos, and my accomplishments in this area are documented on my LinkedIn profile.

#### Company Culture & Practice

My keen interest in company culture has led me to study the dynamics of both large organizations and startups over the past two years. I also enjoy exploring the evolution of engineering culture within fast-growing businesses. My knowledge in this domain has been enriched by resources such as [Y Combinator Startup School](https://www.startupschool.org/), the book ["How Google Works"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/Yk9zAwAAQBAJ?hl=en), and ["Software Engineering At Google"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book).

To connect and discuss potential collaborations, please find me on GitHub, LinkedIn, shoot me an email, or schedule an appointment with me.
